MOST URGENT:
- info screen 
- MCTS bot DONE
- docstring DONE
- write video script 

VIDEO:
- film individually and join together (not optimal)
- possible dates ?
    - this friday (21/04)
    - next thursday (27/04)
    - next friday (28/04) (last day to submit) --> this is not optimal as we want to send all the files to jonchery as early as possible (she might not check her mails during the vacation)

    board stuff:
        - display invalid board instead of print DONE

        - reset edited board to its orginial state when game ends DONE
    
    display scores in game DONE
    display winning player for a few seconds before returning to menu DONE

    implement menu (this is implemented as logic but ui MUST be improved)

        - rules/info screen --> NOT IMPLEMENTED, add game rules + credits (our names/school/idk)

        - game mode DONE, add MCTS bot once done
        - play
   
    immplement random move bot DONE
