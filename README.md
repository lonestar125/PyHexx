# Todo

```
(in order of importance):
    display scores in game
    implement menu (this is implemented as logic but ui MUST be improved)
        - title/banner image/idk
        - rules/info screen --> NOT IMPLEMENTED, add game rules + credits (our names/school/idk)
        - board editor
        - game mode --> NOT IMPLEMENTED
        - play
    keep edited board when game ends
    immplement random move bot
    implement 1 layer bot
    implement MCTS bot
 
    Add sfx (maybe)
```
# Ideas for the rapport
```
- further imrpove board editor to be able to load boards and save boards from an external file
- make a self play neural net similar to alphago zero
```
